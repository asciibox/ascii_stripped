ascii viewer
==============

This is an ANSI viewer, a stripped version of the ascii rocks editor. Contains pure JS and HTML to show .ANS files in the window, not more. Also adds scrollbars if the ANSI file exceeds the width and height of the window.

Contains a default.txt and create_default.php in case you deploy this somewhere, the original .ANS might have the wrong encoding, create_default.php then creates a correct .ANS file from the text file which can get shown online.

By default, test.ans will get shown.
